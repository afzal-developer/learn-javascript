    <h1>Javascript</h1>
    <p>Programming language<br>Understandable by computer machines. <br> Using logics to make the computer understand what to do. <br>
        
        1. Inupt code (Instructions in the form of code) <br>
        2. Processing <br>
        3. Output (Computer understands what to do and do it). <br> </p>

        alert("This is an alert messgage"); <br> </p>
        
        <h1>Professional way to write the code: </h1>
        
        <p>Write the codes in any code editor like

        <p>
            const product = {
